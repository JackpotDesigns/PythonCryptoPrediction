<p align="CENTER">Technical Project Reports: A Students Guide</p>
</font><font size="5"><p align="CENTER">(10/04/00)</p>
</font><font size="4"><p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="CENTER">Chapter 1 Introduction</p>
</font><p align="JUSTIFY">1.1 Aim</p>
</b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">This document describes a recommended way to write and lay out engineering and scientific project reports. It is aimed at helping students to write project reports suitable for Master�s level projects (MSc, MEng, and MPhil) and for final year BEng projects.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Layouts other than this recommended plan can be used, but you should have <b>good reasons</b> for deviating from the plan. This plan has been developed over a number of years with many students for both academic and industrially related projects and has been found to be very effective.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Some attempt has been made in this report itself to follow the recommended plan in order to give the reader an example. However, this is not in itself a technical report so squeezing it into a technical report plan is somewhat artificial, so some deviations from the plan have been inevitable.</p>
</font><b><p align="JUSTIFY">1.2 Motivation</p>
</b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The main aim of this report is to provide supplementary reading material to guide the student. This should free up time in tutorials for the supervisor to highlight the points he feels most important about writing a report. It will provide a standard report layout framework, which should lead to more consistency, aiding the examiners, especially the external examiners from other institutions. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Some elements of this guide may also subsequently be helpful to students who progress to PhD level or who go on either to write scientific journal papers or reports for industry.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The guidance notes in this report have developed as a result of the direct supervision and marking of numerous projects. Areas where students generally have difficulty have been emphasised. Project reports have been marked in detail and annotated with (hopefully) helpful red corrective comments. Thereafter, the red comments made have been scanned and discussions have been included in this guide on most of the common errors actually made to prevent students falling into the same traps. The student�s reports from which these have been gleaned include the three reports and their corresponding drafts for each BEng final year project, MEng, MSc, MPhil project reports as well as PhD theses and papers and all of their drafts including many whose authors did not have English as their first language. Even the text of this document has been criticised in a similar way by undergraduates commenting upon my writing style!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Over the last 20 years or so there have been regular reports in the press complaining about the poor report writing skills of technical graduates fresh from university beginning at their companies. We hope that this guide may form part of a remedy and that you will feel proud to show your final report to your friends, parents, sponsors and future employers at interview as an example of the quality of work that you can produce.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><p align="JUSTIFY">1.3 The reasons for writing a technical project report</p>
</b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the most useful three comments that can be made to help you in writing your report are:</p>
<ol>

<li>When formulating the overall plan of your report and when writing each section and subsection, consider for what purpose and for whom that section is being written and then decide how to write it and lay it out to meet that purpose.</li>
<li>Your aim is to make the report easy to read so that the report can be read, understood and assimilated. This usually means that you will need to do extra work to make it less work for the reader.</li>
<li>You need to keep your reader�s attention. He needs to be attracted by the title, his interest aroused by the abstract and then maintained throughout the report - otherwise he will put it aside and go and do something else.</li></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us expand on the first point above now, the other points will underlie much of the detailed guidance given later and will be alluded to there. It will help you to write the various parts of the report if you keep in mind who that section is aimed at and why you are writing a report at all. Imagine the potential readers and their reaction to what you have written. A very common mistake is for a student to write a report assuming that the reader is familiar with the subject, and to think that the purpose of the report or chapter is for the reader/examiner to check that the student is conversant in it. In this case the student writes meagre details that do not hold together as a logical sequence. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>

<li>Can you explain clearly what you have done?</li>
<li>Can you explain concisely? </li>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is actually easier to write a long report but no one has the time to read a long report in detail and one important sentence may be overlooked. The word limit specified may seem too short, but this is to help you develop the skill of condensing the text and throwing away irrelevant information.</p>
<li>Can you order your thoughts and plan the report layout logically?</li>
<li>Proof Reading: </li></ol>
<dir>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Have you paid attention to detail, checking the spelling and removing typographical errors? Have you checked that the photocopier has not stuck and that there are no pages which are duplicated or missing? Have you put in the figures and the appendices you refer to? Are the pages numbered in sequential order?</p></dir>

<p align="JUSTIFY">5) 	Have you gone about achieving your project aim in the most sensible way and in a logical fashion?</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">It is also worth thinking about what benefits learning to write a project report will be to you later. Students may go on to work in industry or go on to a higher degree or may even leave the technical field altogether. If you are in the final year of an BSc or BEng degree, then you may consider going on to take a Master�s, MSc. This is generally a one-year course consisting of lectures and project work, or sometimes just project work alone with the assessment being carried out on three submitted project reports or theses. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="i">

<li>Industrial Projects</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If you take up employment in industry you are likely to work on a series of projects, often as part of a project team. Throughout the project you will most likely have to write reports each month, larger reports every 6 months to a year and a major report at the end of the project. If you are ambitious and rise to a managerial position then you will be expected to submit proposals (in the form of reports) for development of products to the senior management for approval. If they are not written well enough your development work will not get funded.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<li>MPhil/PhD</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Students may go on from a BEng, BSc, MEng and MSc to begin a PhD. The student will normally begin by registering for an MPhil in the first instance. After one year of research and perhaps some courses, a project report or MPhil to PhD Transfer thesis will be written describing the literature surveys and any research carried out. If this is good enough the student will continue on for a further two or so years and will write up a PhD thesis which is a more advanced technical project report covering the last three years of research.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<li>Technical Papers</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The results of your research in your project at any stage from BSc project to beyond PhD may be written up as a technical paper and submitted for publication in a respected journal if the expert referees think your paper is up to the standard of their journal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<li>Proposals and Final Reports</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If you go on to become an academic following a period of employment as a research fellow you will not only be expected to write papers but you will also have to submit proposals to grant awarding bodies and to companies for funding. If the project is funded interim reports may be required. At the end of the project a final report on the whole project will be required by a firm deadline. If this is not submitted on time or is of insufficient quality the consequences may be serious regarding future funding from that source.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<li>Non-technical</li></ol>
<dir>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If you leave the technical world and take up employment elsewhere you will no doubt have to carry out studies, for example, marketing surveys. You will have to write up these studies as a final report summarising your finding and recommendations.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p></dir>

<p align="JUSTIFY">So the reason there are project reports in the university project is to prepare you for these real world situations which you will meet afterwards. At University you have the chance to learn report writing skills in, hopefully, a less threatening and more supportive environment. This document describes a framework for a technical project report that can easily be adapted to be of use in all of the above various situations to a greater or lesser extent. Clearly, it is difficult to condense the common essentials out of all of the above situations and so different examiners may place different emphasis on different aspects of the report depending towards which future goal they feel you are being trained.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><font size="4"><p align="CENTER"><a name="Chapter_2">Chapter 2 The Examiners� Viewpoint</a></p>
</font></b><font size="2"><p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">You are writing a report, which will be marked by the appointed examiners. It is helpful for you if you can see the examiners� viewpoint, because they will give marks for aspects they consider to be laudable and may deduct marks for poor aspects. Normally, you will have two examiners from the academic staff of your department, one of whom may be your supervisor and one may possibly come from another university. Apart from these appointed examiners who mark your work the academic appointed to co-ordinate the projects will put together a team of academics from your department to check that all of the examiners mark to a similar standard. In addition to all this an external examiner will read your report and check that there have not been any oversights in the marking and that the standard is correct compared to other universities in the country, and perhaps around the world.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The main point to bear in mind is that the examiners do not make arbitrary choices about what aspects they consider to be good. Their aim is to train you to be able to write better reports for real life situations such as those described in the section on Future Benefits. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><p align="JUSTIFY">2.1 Specification</p>
</b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">Three reports are usually required for a project, each of which must have no more than a certain specified number of words and they must be handed in by a deadline. A typical specification is as follows:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>

<li>The First Interim Report (2000 words maximum or 10 pages) 5% of total mark</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Including the objectives of the project, the background to the work, suggesting a suitable approach to the problem, including a time scale plan for the work ahead</p>
<li>The Second Interim Report (3500 words maximum or 17.5 pages) which together with the student�s performance in a viva with two examiners amounts to 15% of the total mark</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Emphasis in this report should be on the description of the work done so far, and on the expectations and plans to finish the work.</p>
<li>The Final Report (8000 words maximum or 40 pages) 50% of total mark</li></ol>
<dir>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Marked according to the following headings: Originality and independence, Effort and dedication, Achievement. "Final reports should be well structured, with an abstract, an introduction describing the problem and its background, intermediate sections as appropriate, describing the theory and developments, a clear presentation of results, conclusions and properly prepared references. The report should give a clear description of the problem tackled, the methods used to solve it, the results obtained and the student's original contribution."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p></dir>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In addition there is usually an assessment of an oral presentation to a group of examiners and students (15% of the total mark) and a �project work mark� (15% of the total mark) which is an assessment of the weekly or fortnightly meetings with the supervisor and sustained effort throughout the year.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Deadlines for submission are usually strict so that marks will be lost if the project is handed in late, typically, 5% marks lost during the 7 days after the deadline and 10% lost for each week thereafter. Some departments are more severe and cut marks by half for the first week after the deadline and then no marks are awarded if the report is more than a week late! This may seem severe but in fact is lenient when compared with submission of a research proposal to a grant awarding authority in UK or EU where if it is after the deadline it is not considered at all. Similarly, submission of a research paper to a conference needs to be by a deadline. Papers that are delivered a couple of days after the deadline may be considered at the discretion of the conference organising committee. Submission of a final report for a project supported by a UK grant awarding body must be delivered by a deadline. If it is not submitted on time you will have to hand back a substantial sum of money to the grant awarding body as a penalty and subsequent requests for funding may fall on deaf ears. Of course, if you are ill or have some extenuating circumstances then you must see the project co-ordinator preferably at least a week before the deadline to discuss the situation and he may, at his discretion, allow you an extension of the deadline. If you go to see him a few minutes before the deadline and say you need an extra week you are unlikely to get much sympathy. A typical reason for last minute appeals is that the computer network has crashed due to the students in the year all trying to print out their reports in time for the deadline, at the last minute. Similarly, the printer paper may have run out, the photocopiers may have broken or the toner may have run out. It is normal for these to happen at a deadline so you must anticipate this and plan your printing taking this into account and no extension to the deadline on these grounds can be expected. If the academics coincide several deadlines for reports for which you are not aware, then it may be reasonable for you to receive extra time unless you have been pre-warned of these coincident deadlines.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The first report is not worth a large proportion of the marks. However, it is important. This is your first attempt at writing the final report. If you do not use the correct layout or miss out abstracts you will not have the benefit of having your supervisor comment on your attempt. Now is the time when you can afford to make mistakes while trying to do your best as you will not lose many marks. This will be the first the examiners will see of your ability to write reports. If you give them a good document they will mentally categorise you as a good student. This may subconsciously influence them when they come to mark your subsequent reports. First impressions are important and tend to last. Of course if your subsequent reports are worse than a good first report the examiners will have no hesitation in giving you an appropriately low mark. Students tend to think that as the report has few marks it is not worth spending much time over it and this results in a poor report. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Aspects considered by the examiners:</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">Here are just some of the aspects considered by the examiners in awarding a final grade for a report. Some of the aspects are directly related to the report whereas others can be indirectly deduced from the report and meetings with the supervisor.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Independence:</p>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Has the supervisor had to continually push the student and give him regular �pep talks� to motivate him or was the student self-motivated?</li>
<li>How long was it before the student got to grips with the project so that the supervisor let him take control and determine his own directions?</li>
<li>Did the student voluntarily come once a week to see the supervisor to report his results and receive advice or did the supervisor have to contact him, or even lead him into his office from the corridor when the supervisor saw him passing.</li>
<li>Did the student spontaneously suggest what he should do next or did he do nothing unless the supervisor told him what to do and how to do it?</li>
<li>How much was his own effort and how much was done by his supervisor or other members of his supervisor�s research group?</li>
<li>Did he copy it out of a book or from a colleague?</li></ul>

<b><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Effort:</p>

</b><ul><b>

</font></b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Before putting pen to paper or typing the first word:</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">The start of compiling a report really begins with the gathering of the data that will go into it. This data gathering will normally be a part of your project anyway. However, you need to remember to gather all the data necessary to provide a clear logical argument when you write your report and not just the data for the final result. It is common for students to leave the collection of this extra data until the point where they sit down and work out a report plan, when they suddenly realise that to present a convincing and clear explanation of the work they ought to have collected certain data earlier. Unfortunately, it is likely to be too late to collect the data at that point, as the experimental hardware may have been dismantled (or parts of it �borrowed� by another student), or the computer may be unavailable or all of the software compilers may have been updated and may not be compatible. The secret is to think about what you will need to write a report at the time that you are doing it and not later. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When you obtain an important experimental result always obtain a hardcopy of it. You may not be able to reproduce the same conditions later to get the same result; the experimental device or circuit may have been broken during subsequent experiments or the temperature or humidity may have changed, for example. Always take photographs of the layout of experimental equipment. These can be placed next to a schematic block diagram of the experimental layout in your report - colour photographs can be very helpful. When the project involves software it can be useful to make screen dumps or print out the screen or photograph the screen. Think about the scale of graphs carefully and try to keep similar scales on several graphs. If you plot graphs, try to avoid scribbling comments all over them, as you may want to use it in your final report. Conversely, it is important to label each graph to identify the values of the experimental parameters that had been set during that run. When you carry out your literature survey bear in mind that you will need to have a list of references at the end of your report. So you may want to keep the references in a database in the correct format. Note that some fonts are actually larger than others, for example Palatino is actually larger than Times for the same font size.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Obtain a copy of one or two project reports written by earlier students that your supervisor considers being of a high quality. Note that you must treat these reports with complete confidentiality. Find out from your supervisor if there are any special report requirements that he would like which may differ from this recommended plan, or from the reports of earlier students. Please do not copy the mistakes of earlier students! What aspects does your supervisor consider to be very important and is there anything that he would particularly like you to concentrate on? </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If you have two supervisors or examiners you may wish to consult them both as they may have differing opinions and you may encourage them to agree on a format. You would not want one to mark you down because you used a format recommended by the other. Although we have written a recommended report outline below, this is not the only way to do it, although this outline has proved to be favourable with many examiners.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is sometimes said that the report must look like a book and in many respects it should. It needs to look as authoritative as a book, it should be bound and have chapters. Books are good for giving an idea about presentation. However, do not slavishly copy the layout of your favourite textbook. Reports generally do not have prefaces, forewords or bibliographies, or brief descriptions of the life of the author and so on.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><p align="JUSTIFY">3.1 The Report Outline:</p>
</b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">Before making a start on writing any paragraphs of text, it is essential to make a report layout plan (rather like an essay plan). Some students may be unfamiliar with the discipline of preparing an essay plan. Most commonly students do not write a plan and begin writing text. However, when you write text you are usually coming from somewhere and going somewhere in order to make some overall point. Writing text in isolation means that it will not fit in with this overall logical flow of the report. Perhaps more seriously, your supervisor may tell you after you have spent several weeks writing text that he wants it to be written in a certain way or does not want what you have written about to be put into the final report at all! So all your effort may be wasted. Therefore, it is very important to consult your supervisor with a report outline before beginning substantial writing.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is essential to present the various parts of your work in a logical order as part of a logical framework. This is just as much true for the overall layout of the chapters of your report as for the subsections within each chapter and as for the logical progression of ideas within a paragraph. You may find it helpful to draw flow charts in your notebook to put your ideas in order.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The best way to get useful feedback and direction from your supervisor and the first step in committing words to paper is to write down all of the titles of ALL of the sections in the order in which you plan to put them. Under each chapter title put all of the subsection titles in the order in which you wish to put them. In each chapter subsection write 2 sentences saying what you plan to put in that section. One figure could also be included if it gives your supervisor a better idea of what you intend to write about. As a guide, a three to four page outline is enough for a 3500 word report. Estimate how many pages you will need for each subsection so that you do not overrun the page limit and write these figures on your plan. Even if there is no formal page limit, you should try to keep the number of pages down because it is a good discipline and skill to learn how to précis and describe in a few words clearly what you are trying to say. Moreover, the examiner usually has only limited time and if it is too long he will not be able to do the text enough justice. In order to help you with your plan we describe a standard report layout in the next section.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Some students who are not familiar with writing report plans may find it so difficult to devise one that it is easier for them to start writing the report. They may begin writing at a random place and gradually add sections and cut and paste as they go to put the report into a logical order. Eventually the final ideal logical structure for their report will become clear to them as they recall items that they wish to include. However, it is almost impossible to chop up a badly written report and cut and paste sections and sentences around the document to end up with a satisfactory result without even more effort rewriting most of it to regain the flow. It is almost less effort to begin again, now that the logical framework has been established and rewrite the report again from scratch. It is certainly a lot less effort to devise a suitable report plan in the first place. This is where the supervisor�s advice can be particularly helpful.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><p align="JUSTIFY">3.2 The more detailed report outline:</p>
</b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">Once you have agreed the report outline with your supervisor you can either begin writing or, certainly if you are writing a very long report (8000 words), you can make a more detailed report outline. The more detailed outline can have 10 sentences or phrases in each subsection, with notes and words reminding you of <b>all </b>of the topics that you wish to cover and the logical order in which you wish to write about them. It is helpful to divide the text into subsections within which you cover only one topic.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is common to see students� reports where the student has remembered several points only after completing most of the text and so these points are inserted but stand out to the examiner as they break the flow of the argument. Therefore, it is important to try to recall all of the topics you wish to discuss at this point and put down words reminding you to write about them in the logical place where they fit into the argument. This is a mentally taxing task and is probably harder work than writing the text itself and so students often avoid it preferring to write the text. However, the rewards of the correct approach via an outline and a more detailed outline are worth the effort. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><p align="JUSTIFY">3.3 The First Draft of the Report</p>
</b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">The draft report is your first complete attempt at producing the report itself. That means you need to try to get everything in the right place and spelt correctly. No doubt your supervisor will cover it in red annotations, but this will be of most use if the draft report is as complete as possible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The most important parts of a report are the Introduction, the Conclusions and Future work, and the Abstract. A common mistake is for a student to spend the least amount of time writing these sections allowing insufficient time to complete them properly. The result is that they are often written in a rush just before the handing in deadline and often have spelling, typographical and grammatical errors. Since a lot of value is placed on these sections by the examiners this is a serious mistake and can cost marks. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">English:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This is mainly aimed at students whose first language is not English although some reports from English students have the same problems. It is not your supervisor�s job to correct your English. When he reads your report he may correct your English or may put rings around incorrect words or put signs indicating missing words. He may do this because he is kind or because he cannot help correcting every mistake in sight to help you when writing your next report. However, you will be wasting his time and expertise. If he is spending his time correcting your English he will not be spending that time thinking about whether your logical arguments are correct, or the content of your sentences which is far more important. It is no good telling him to ignore your poor English. In his struggle to understand the content of each of your sentences he is forced to consider the English. It is also tiring for the supervisor to try to work out what it is that you mean if it is not explained clearly. Since the advent of computer spelling checkers there is now little excuse for spelling errors and so examiners view these errors more severely. It is very impolite and disrespectful to give your supervisor text littered with spelling and grammatical errors that could have been corrected in a short time by the use of a word processing package. You would not think of giving your supervisor a report that had been screwed up and thrown in a bin, or one that you had stood on, or your cat had walked over or one with too many coffee stains (although supervisors have had all these handed in to them in their time!). Poor English is perhaps not quite as bad but in a similar league. So what can you do? Obviously the best thing to do is to improve your English but there may not be time left for this if you have not already planned ahead and done this. You could give the report to other English students and ask them to correct it and you could read through theirs and correct their typographical errors and logic and maths in return. Alternatively you could give it to some friendly PhD students or research fellows and ask them politely to correct it. Alternatively, there are people to whom you could give it who will correct it for a fee (but not the technical English) such as secretaries in the university, or people associated with the university�s language teaching centre, or available in adverts in the newspaper. My experience is that they can be rather expensive and are not experienced at the technical English so try to use the former techniques. At the end of this document there is a section dealing with common errors of English.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Style:</p>
<p>Avoid repeating the same word more than once in the same sentence or in adjacent sentences as it makes the text difficult to read.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Once your supervisor has given you back your draft report with comments take these comments very seriously and modify the text in response to each comment. Of course, if you have written it badly in the first place there may be lots of comments or your supervisor may not have time to comment on all of the errors but just the worst ones. This is particularly important if your supervisor is also the examiner of the report and will have to mark it. He will no doubt remember that he had asked you to correct something and if you do not do it you will be more severely penalised. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Once a student has put pen to paper and written text, and particularly when that text has been typed into a word processor students are often reluctant to alter it. This is understandable, as it was a considerable effort to conceive the content and to form and write the text. However, what one writes first can often be written better in hindsight having written most of the rest of the report, or in the light of supervisor�s comments. Students try to keep the text by moving it somewhere else in the report, or by adding and deleting words. It is almost as if what has been written must stand as if inscribed in stone, and as if the student will only permit minor alterations to be made. It is important to be able to let go of the precise text and rewrite it if necessary. One example of this is when a student submits a first report, which is then annotated and commented on by the supervisor. The student may do the corrections and then use that same text as part of their next report. This certainly reduces effort in producing bulk, but bulk is not what is required. The text written in the early days of a project was written when the student had little knowledge of the project field of study and can seem naive and even wrong in the light of the increased knowledge and experience which ought to have been gained by the time of writing the next report. In order to establish what can and what cannot be left it may be useful for you to go through the previous report yourself, marking corrections you would like to make. Note unclear passages, incorrect grammar or facts and so on. If a passage contains a lot of your red marks then rewrite it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In a number of countries students begin writing reports at the start of the project and continue writing to the end. So as the student�s knowledge improves the quality of writing improves. This is not what is required here. You should write your whole report <b>after</b> completing the project. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><font size="4"><p align="CENTER"><a name="Chapter_4">Chapter 4 The Report Format</a></p>
</font></b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">Here we give a recommended framework for the final report. Earlier interim reports will also have the same format except that since less has been done the emphasis will be different. In the first report the most important sections are the aim and the time plan for carrying out the project. Your supervisor will want to check that you have understood the aim and have devised a logical set of experiments or tasks to get you from the start to achieving the aims by the end of the allotted time. In the second report the most important section is likely to be the subject reviews and reviews of relevant papers as by then you are likely to have begun your project by carrying out a literature search and brief survey.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Cover Page</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">The cover page should include the following items but the order and layout is up to you. However, the font needs to be readable from some distance away and the title but not your name is often in bold. It is generally agreed that text written all in upper case is harder to read than normal text in upper and lower case. However, a short title may be acceptable in upper case. It is worth experimenting with different fonts also and deciding which one is easiest to read from a distance. Do not squeeze all of the other text apart from the title into one corner of the page in a small font. Generally all of the font on this page should be larger than that in the body of the report.</p>
<b><i><p align="CENTER">The title of the project</p>
</i></b><p align="JUSTIFY">This should be the most apt and concise title. Keep it less than about 10 words if possible. It should enable a reader to immediately find out the subject with which the report deals. The title may not be the original title of the project as during the course of research the aim may have changed. However, the title should describe what the reader should expect to find in that report. �Snappy� titles are best and the easiest to remember. Moreover, the title and abstract may be put into a database so you need to include keywords in the title, which will allow this project to be located when the database is searched using certain keywords.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Examples: Mobile Robot, A high-speed fibre optic link: Photoreceiver Design, Computer generated holograms � Theory, Design and Fabrication</p>
<b><i><p align="CENTER">The author</p>
</i></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Your personal name in full, initials for other names, Surname or Family name in full (it may be in upper case or underlined to distinguish it from your personal name if it is likely to be confused with it by the potential reader)</p>
<b><i><p align="CENTER">The supervisor(s)</p>
</i></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Your supervisor�s name, the second assessor�s name, the industrial supervisor�s name (if any). It is a good idea to spell your supervisor�s name correctly! You do not want to annoy him while he�s marking your report! Spelling checkers will not check people�s names. In fact, any spelling mistakes on this page should be avoided, as good first impressions are important.</p>
<b><i><p align="CENTER">The date of completion of the report</p>
<p align="CENTER">Title identifying report</p>
</i></b><p align="JUSTIFY">For example, First interim report, Final Report for Third year project 2000-2001, etc.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The degree for which the report is submitted. Sometimes the university will require that a statement must be included to the effect that �This report is submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the MSc degree�.</p>
<b><i><p align="CENTER">The department and university.</p>
</i></b><i></i><p align="CENTER"><i><b>Optional: Commercial-in-Confidence.</b></i> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Your supervisor or industrial sponsor may require this statement to warn readers that anything they may read must not be discussed freely. The company or your supervisor may wish to obtain a patent and this will be impossible if the ideas in the report are publicised. This title should be put centrally at the top of the page as a warning.</p>
<b><i><p align="CENTER">Optional: Diagram or Picture</p>
</i></b><p align="JUSTIFY">This is optional. A figure or diagram that immediately makes clear what is in the report. A coloured figure or photograph may be attractive but may draw attention away from the title. Coloured pages often cost more to print and copy. Certainly figures of poor quality or poor resolution should not be put on the first page as this will give the reader a poor impression of your presentation skills even before he has begun reading your report.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<a name="abstract">
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Abstract</p></b></a><b>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">The abstract needs to say what is in this report, what you have tried to do and have achieved. It is not simply a summary. The abstract should be between half a page and a page in length, and is definitely a test of whether you can be concise. However, you need to take care not to make this section too terse to be unreadable and it must not be simply a list of notes as it needs to hold together. A well written abstract and conclusions can raise your degree to the next class under certain circumstances so it is certainly worth putting the time in to write them well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The abstract is aimed at being read by a very busy professor or industrial manager. In industry the manger may not be an engineer and even if he is he may not be an expert in the field of study of your report. The busy manager may have been attracted by the title when searching a computer database using key words. This may have been sufficiently interesting for him to want to find out more so he is now reading the abstract, which he may also have downloaded from a database. He is trying to find out if it is either worth him getting hold of a complete copy of your report or reading further. Assume that if he cannot identify what he needs to within 5 minutes that he will consign it to the bin! The abstract needs to clearly state the <b>objectives</b> of the project.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Titles of projects and abstracts are sometimes put onto computer databases so that interested people can find your project by typing in keywords. If your title and/or abstract do not include the key words typed in then your report will not be found. A good idea is to write down the key words and phrases that if typed into a database search should find your report. The abstract must be written ensuring that all of these are present. Make sure major achievements and successes are clearly stated. A few quantitative numbers can be included but do not overdo it. If the numerical values of the quantities are not immediately obvious as an improvement or immediately informative to a potential reader leave them out. So, for example, if relevant, frequency ranges are almost essential or at least RF, VHF, UHF, to help the reader pinpoint exactly what it is that you cover in your report. On the other hand try to avoid using acronyms or at least explain them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Acknowledgements</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">This is essential although often forgotten by students. You must thank all of the people who have helped you or supported you financially in your project. Many of the people who pick up your report will only read this section to make sure you have thanked them! If you are sponsored your sponsors will want to see that you have acknowledged their support. There may be a form of word that your sponsors require you to put here to thank them. It will put your examiners in a better frame of mind for reading the rest of the report if they see that you have remembered the help they have given. Remember other students, or research fellows or technicians who have helped. You may wish to thank your supervisor�s research group if they have helped. Take care to avoid empty gaps that sometimes occur.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Optional: Dedications, Forewords, Preface, etc.</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">A very few students put additional pages such as a dedication to their parents, or to a deity they may worship. However, dedicating a poor report to someone could be taken as an insult as if that is all they are worth.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Some put a quotation from a famous person or book. These are usually stretched to mean something that the original author never intended, and so do not usually amuse or impress the examiners. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is generally better to avoid including any extra pages in a technical report.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Contents</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">Chapters must be numbered 1, 2, 3�, subsections numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.. and sub-sub-sections numbered 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, �.. Don�t have too many sub-sub-sub-sub�. sections. All pages must be numbered sequentially usually beginning with Chapter 1 on page 1. The contents list should have all of the Chapter titles at the left margin, the sub sections indented, the sub-sub-sections indented further and so on. The page numbers of each must be put aligned. Do not just put the page numbers for the Chapters only. Students commonly forget to number the Reference pages and the Appendix pages or forget them altogether. It is not necessary to number pages before the first page of chapter one but if you feel you must then the convention is to number from the first page using i, ii, iii, �.and also to include in the table of contents.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the contents list is to help the reader to see how the work is organised and to enable the reader to turn directly to the section of most interest to him. Therefore all of the titles must explain clearly but concisely what is to be found in that section. Each title must stand-alone so that they are understandable on their own and do not depend on the reader having read an earlier title. Make sure the titles in the contents list are the same as the titles in the text.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The judicious use of bold, italic, upper and lower case can improve the speed of the reader�s understanding of the contents list but if overdone, it can reduce clarity. Make sure the title at the top of the page is large and sufficiently imposing.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Within a section or subsection dealing with one subject it is possible to use lists and not to record these in the contents. These lists will usually have labels, 1), 2),� or i), ii),� or (a), (b),� Don�t use the same labels more than once in the same section or subsection.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Make sure that you put the number and title of every appendix. Students very commonly just put the letter but not the title. This is of no help to the reader to decide whether they wish to read that section or not.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Abbreviations, Symbols, Acronyms, Nomenclature and Notation Table</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">It is helpful for the reader to have a common table to refer to, to enable him to understand the abbreviations, symbols, acronyms and notation that you have used. Of course you should try to use standard abbreviations, and notation in common usage. E for electric Field, for example, or G(f) for the Fourier Transform of g(t). The first time you use an abbreviation you must explain what it means but this table will save you having to explain it over and over again in every sub section. On the other hand it may be useful to explain the abbreviation more than once in the text in different parts of the report. Only use a symbol to represent one quantity throughout the report otherwise it will confuse the reader if he has to urn back and forth in the text. Make sure you use the right symbol, so don�t put �j� in this section if you used �i� in the text.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Optional: List of Figure Captions</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">This is rather like a contents list for figures. The figure number and caption taken exactly as appears under the figure should be rewritten here. This table tends to be of more use to the student in helping to put together the report than for the reader. When scientific papers are written and submitted for publication in learned journals it is common for the journal to ask for this list to help in typesetting to check that all of the figures are present in the correct order.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Chapter 1 Introduction</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">First make sure that the title is sufficiently large and imposing as warranted by a chapter. Experiment with the use of bold, underlining, font, and size of font and layout to obtain the required effect. Small titles can easily be missed and mistaken for part of the chapter text. Use a capital letter for the number of the chapter or a number. Keep short and snappy titles on one line if possible as it is easier to read quickly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Unlike the abstract, the Introduction tends to be written in a more friendly and approachable style. It is aimed at being read by a student in your year but who is doing a different project. He will be intelligent with a good general electronic engineering background but unfamiliar with the particular field of study of your project. Do not let the level of discussion drop to writing for school pupils.</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Section 1.1 The Aim</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">One or two sentences at most describing the aim or goal of the work described in the report. This is a test of your ability to write concisely. The original aim may have changed, so this is the aim of the work in the report - not necessarily what you were originally trying to achieve. State your objectives clearly.</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Section 1.2 Motivation</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">In this section the problem that you are trying to tackle should be clearly stated in the context of other similar work that has been carried out by others. What is the reason why anyone should be doing a project to try to achieve the aim stated in section 1.1? An appreciation of why you have done the project in the way you have done it is needed here. A little of the background to the area of study may need to be described to allow the reader to put your work in context. If this brief background begins to get too long you could spawn another section following the motivation and before the layout. The motivation section is generally between 1 and 4 pages. Save any, in depth, reviews of the subject for later chapters. When did work on this subject first begin? Which companies or countries developed the field most? What benefit will the results of your project be to mankind, the electronics industry, etc? Who is anxious to know the result of what you have been trying to do and why? Has anyone tackled this problem before? If so who?</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Section 1.3 Layout of Report</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">This section is generally rather poorly written. The reader already has access to your list of contents so it must not just be a list. You need to explain <b>why</b> you ordered your report this way and <b>why</b> you included chapters on certain topics? Are there any key sections that the reader must see and any that could be omitted on a first reading without losing the sense of your arguments? Try to avoid repeating �Then�� which should not be at the start of a sentence anyway.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Chapter 2 First Subject Literature Review</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Second Subject Literature Review</p>
</b></font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">These chapters describe all of the relevant earlier work reported by other people to allow the reader to fully appreciate how your work fits into the field of study at large. You should have taken some time to work out a plan for the whole report, and to divide your reviews of earlier work into 2 or 3 logical subject reviews. Each of these reviews is the subject of one chapter each of which is intimately connected to the table of references, which appears at the end of the whole report (or optionally at the end of each chapter). You should have begun your project by carrying out a thorough literature search but you may need to supplement these references by a further quick search in the light of the knowledge you have gained as a result of doing the project and to update them in a fast moving research field due to more recent publications. Every statement you make must either be logically proved starting from earlier statements, or you must state from where you obtained that knowledge. This can be done by putting a number in the text [1] that refers to a similarly numbered reference in the reference list. Numbers must start with 1 and increase numerically in the order in which you refer to the references. Alternatively the references for each chapter can be numbered [2.1, 2.2, 2.3]. It is conventional to use square brackets [2,3] or superscripts</font><sup><font size="1">2,3 </font></sup><font size="2">in a smaller font. Alternatively you can use the first author�s name (X. Y. Zee et al.) or you can use a standard code (ZEE98) with the first three letters of the first author and the year. If you or your supervisor do not have strong preferences then put all the references at the end of the whole document and use numbers in square brackets.</font></p><font size="2">

<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The experienced report reader will expect to see a reference where you make almost any statement that you do not justify or prove from earlier statements in the text using logic. The experienced reader will perceive this absence of a reference almost as if a word were missing, because the text is just asking for a reference. It will take you some time to learn where to put references. If you read good reports, and journal papers and textbooks you will see where to and where not to reference.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If you have decided to only put one thorough review chapter you may need to describe all of the work carried out that is most similar to what you have done. Or you may use this opportunity to �teach� the reader about some key points that are essential to an understanding of your work. Alternatively the review might concentrate on explaining in detail the content of just a few papers which are most relevant to your work. This is where looking at good reports written by earlier students of your supervisor can be useful.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Students sometimes write a history of the subject, or copy it from books or earlier students� reports. This is definitely not what is required and any form of copying is frowned upon. Copying without acknowledgement is plagiarism and an extremely serious offence as it is cheating. We want you to say in your own words what you understood after reading the references. The only things that can be copied are diagrams and figures but even then you must give an appropriate reference. It is common to do this by putting (after Prof. X.Y. Zee[10]) at the end of the caption. It is better to redraw the figure yourself, but we appreciate how long it takes to redraw a figure on computer so a limited number of such figures are permitted.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If you are putting equations make sure you define every symbol there just before or just after the equation. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A table is a good way to compare the results of earlier workers� experiments or devices or systems performance. One of the columns should list the references [??] for each reported performance. Order the columns appropriately which may be by date, or from best to worst performance, for example. Do not just put a table but explain its contents in words in the text. Which is the best and why and discuss the relative merits. Do not leave it to the reader to do the work of comparing. Point out all of the comparisons that you would like the reader to note.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">An alternative layout is to locate the most relevant ten or so papers and then to put the title of each paper followed by a paragraph describing its contents. This is quicker to do for interim reports. However, it is preferable in the final report to combine it into a single paragraph.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Chapters 4, 5, 6 The work you have done</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">The reader is looking to see if you have devised a set of tests or experiments, which logically proves something without leaving any holes in the logic.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Take care to define all of the terms you use. You may well be very familiar with various jargons and terms but the reader may not be, so always explain and define them. In equations be sure to define every term and symbol, preferably immediately before the equation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Students have a tendency to present all of their experimental findings and data and then not go on to discuss what they mean. In many ways the discussion is a very important part of the report. It shows whether you are able, not just to take measurements correctly, but also to interpret and to analyse them logically. It is in the discussion that you may present your new ideas for why the experiment did not go as expected, for why the theory did not agree with the experiment to within the experimental error (error bars).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At the end of the detailed in-depth discussion of experimental and theoretical results you must try to stand back and take an overview of your work and the direction of your work. Students find this a very hard thing to do, as they have been involved in the details of the work for the last year or so. Stand back and question whether you really did the best tests or experiments to achieve the goal you were trying to reach. Even if your supervisor told you what to do step by step you must still question it � students do not seem to have a problem doing this although they sometimes have a problem expressing it tactfully in the report!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">4.1 Theory</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">In some calculations it is often required to find the maximum of a function and students commonly say that by differentiating the function and setting it to zero they found the maximum. In fact, if that is all they really did they may have found the minimum by mistake. Make sure you say what you actually did. If you took the second derivative to check whether it was a maximum or a minimum say so.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Simply deriving equations is not sufficient. The reader cannot appreciate an equation as it stands. Generally you will need to plot the equation assuming certain reasonable values for certain parameters, or at least indicate its form graphically or in the text.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">4.2 Experiment</p>
</b></font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">You must quantify parameters and so it is to be expected that numbers will appear in the text when you are talking about the results of experiments. Try to use the appropriate prefix before the units to avoid having too many powers of ten or zeros after a decimal point. Take care to change the font of Greek characters otherwise </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">m</font><font size="2">m may become um or mm. Take care on the capitals in the units so decibels should be dB, megahertz should be MHz, and kilohertz should be kHz. Note that there is a capital H in Hz.</font></p><font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This is more of a comment about your experimental technique but you should only change one variable at once and then look at the results of that change. If you change more than one it is impossible to say which change it was due to. Similarly in the text of your report you must show results with only one change being made at a time to prove to the reader that you carried out the experiments in a sensible, logical scientific way.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When a signal is passed through a device or system the output is often measured as a function of frequency, angle, for example. However, the results are meaningless if the input signal is not measured so that the reader can see what effect the system or device has had on the signal. This may mean measuring the power of the incident signal and calculating the output as a ratio expressing it in dB. Often the input power drifts and so has to be repeatedly measured.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes although you may have measured the output as a function of one variable it may be better to convert that variable to another for the plot. So, for example, measurements made in millimetres may be converted to angle if that is more meaningful.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The graph title saying �the difference between X and Y� is a little ambiguous as it is not clear whether the author means X-Y or Y-X which makes a difference to the sign of the result.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">4.3 Discussion</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">The first appendix referred to should be A.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">***</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Chapter 7 Conclusions and Future Work</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Draw out from the text of all of the preceding chapters your achievements and put them all here. The conclusions must state what you achieved as compared to what you set out to achieve in your statement of objectives earlier in the report.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Try to make this section positive. You need to be truthful but try to point out the good achievements to counterbalance any poor results which you should not hide but keep in their proper balance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>7.1 Time Plan and Bar Chart</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">A common mistake is for a student to be too ambitious expecting to complete more work in a given time than will be possible. Things generally take longer than expected. Components take time to be delivered. Equipment or software may not be immediately available. One of the main criticisms is the lack of a detailed bar chart that will allow the student to get from the start to achieve the aim by carrying out the set of actions in the sequence specified.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>Appendix A Title</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">Addresses, web address, e-mail, phone, etc. of suppliers of equipment</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Addresses, web address, e-mail, phone, etc. of researchers around the world who are doing similar work.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Photocopies of key component data sheets,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">PCB layouts,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Engineering drawing of mechanical components,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Computer programs</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Pspice input files</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A list of all of the components, their cost and total cost for a project involving hardware construction.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is surprising how many students fail to give the appendix a title, apart from the heading �Appendix A� which is very uninformative. The title should be short and to the point and aptly describing the contents of that appendix so that the reader can know what is in that section without reading it. Of course, the title must be put in the contents list at the front of the report with page numbers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">References</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">As a rule of thumb a minimum of 10 references are needed for the first report 20 for the second and 30 for the third</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is best just to have one section called References and to make sure that you do indeed refer to each of the references in the text. This shows the reader that you have read the books or papers sufficiently well to at least be able to discuss what is in it in the text. Books and papers which you have not read but which may be helpful to readers or future students carrying on the project can be put in a following section called Bibliography. It is better to avoid having a bibliography if possible. Don�t mix the two into a section called References and Bibliography because then the reader does not know if you have read them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The references are there to allow an interested reader to locate them and to read them himself so if you give insufficient detail to allow a reader to obtain them you have defeated the purpose of having the references. Typical mistakes are, for books, to forget to put the publisher, the city of publication, the edition, the date of publication.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Do not invent your own way of formatting the references. Follow the existing standards (see the list of referrences at the end of this document for examples). Underlining only occurs under the volume number if at all.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Papers</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Personal Contact Details.</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">This is not a part of the report but it is very useful to have them bound together with the report. It consists of a list of contact addresses, which should be valid for the next five years; they may include your parent�s address and the company you are going to work for. The reason for this is so that the university or more likely, following students, who read your report, can contact you about details. This will ensure that no knowledge is lost that you may have forgotten to put in the report or which was unclear. Often students get to know their supervisor very well during a project and ask him to write references for jobs, not only immediately but also many years after leaving and so it is useful for the supervisor to have your details. Put your e-mail address after you leave, phone numbers, fax, etc. Some students put this at the front at the end of the abstract.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><font size="4"><p align="CENTER">Chapter 5 Figures</p>
</font></b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">�A figure is worth a thousand words� [reference] but a figure is not a substitute for a written explanation. It is no good saying that the reader can understand what you are trying to put across when he looks at the figure. You must always say in the text what is in the figure and explain what is happening assuming the reader cannot see the figure. Maybe the figure will get deleted or will not get printed at the last minute or is not included in the draft of the report you give to your supervisor so he needs the explanation in the text. Blind readers will be able to understand a recording of your spoken text. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Take care when using words such as up, down, above, below, in front, behind, which make little sense unless they are defined in the text and the figure as well as the sense of direction for the last two words. It is very easy to make mistakes in the use of these words and to not use them consistently. It is better to avoid using them altogether and instead to define the position of everything in the figure relative to something else or relative to a right hand set of axes (preferably also drawn in the figure).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Conventionally, light and signals must travel from left to right across the figure so that earlier events are towards the left and later towards the right of the figure. Similarly, if you have to draw signals travelling in the vertical direction top to bottom makes the most sense, as the reader will begin at the top.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">All of the figures must be numbered and have an apt concise typed title.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When you have plenty of space it looks a bit silly to abbreviate a title, for example, �Test Cell Intensity Trans�n�</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Captions:</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">Each figure must have a caption that is short and apt and sufficiently detailed to allow the reader to understand what you are showing. Remember, you are very familiar with the work because you may have been looking at it for the last several months but the reader may never have seen it before so do not be afraid to state the obvious to make it clear. The figure caption should have the form:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Figure 3.1 A graph of emitted laser optical power (mW) as a function of input drive current (mA)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">for the first figure in chapter 3. Note that some word processors can cut off some text in a figure caption or label when the figure is inserted into the document; in effect the window for the text is too small. You need to check that your text comes out as you wanted and not expect it to do so.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Graphs:</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">All of the axes of the graph must be labelled and must have units specified. Arbitrary units should not be used. Try to calculate the scaling of the arbitrary units to standard units and label the axis in standard units. When you carry out a measurement in scaled units it is essential to repeat the measurement in order to measure the scaling constant. This often means measuring an object of known dimensions or a calibrated graticule or ruler or using a calibrated frequency source.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When you have several graphs make sure they are all the same size and that their axes all run across the same range of values. The reader can then compare them directly without having to imagine shifting and stretching one graph in his mind in order to compare with another. You must do the work of putting different graphs on the same scale so that the reader does not have to do the work. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Try to make graphs run from zero to some value unless you have a strong reason. The reader usually assumes axes begin at zero so if they do not he may not notice it and so he may incorrectly interpret the graph. Try to avoid graphs with two different scales along different portions of the axis with a zigzag axis in between. These are confusing for the reader to interpret and they can easily make a mistake. It�s preferable to draw two separate graphs instead.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Take a lot of time to think how best to present your results in a graph so that what you are trying to put across to the reader is noticed by the reader immediately. Consider plotting reciprocals of variables and logarithms of variables. Also consider defining new "figures of merit" which may combine several variables into a single dimensionless quantity. It is often useful to plot ratios along each axis so that the resultant graph can be used to represent several different cases with different values of a scaling constant. For example, each variable may be divided by wavelength, </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">l</font><font size="2">. A graph that may have a complicated shape can often be plotted as a straight line if the variables are chosen correctly.</font></p><font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When plotting signals, should you be plotting amplitude or power/intensity? Amplitude is usually plotted on a linear scale and power on a logarithmic decibel scale. The reader will be expecting this so if you plot amplitude or power on other scales you must point it out to the reader, forcibly, in the text and in the figure caption as well as on the figure itself. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Students commonly plot the modulus or absolute value of a quantity and lose the sign. This results in graphs, which smoothly come down to the axis then suddenly have a change in slope and rise again. Physical effects usually produce smooth graphs (of course not always) so this sudden change should warn you. It is no good trying to fit a curve to the absolute value as this slope change is unphysical and is just a result of the way you have plotted it. You should reinstate the sign and then fit a smooth curve.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Three-dimensional graphs with three orthogonal axes can be useful in portraying the dataset. However, some regions of the graph may be obscured by others when hidden lines are deleted. In this case it may be better to change the viewpoint of the observer by rotating the 3D graph about the various axes to show the points of relevance. It is sometimes better to take a vertical view and plot contour plots in a 2D graph instead of plotting a 3D plot directly. The use of colour can bring a 3D plot to life and get your point across the reader faster. Colour printers and colour photocopiers, however, are more expensive and less available, so be sparing. Another problem is that when the coloured areas between the contours are plotted on a black and white printer only grey levels will result. This may be satisfactory if each colour represents a different grey level, but a common problem occurs when the ordering of the darkness of the grey levels produced does not agree with continuously increasing values of the parameter being represented by the contours. So on a plot of smoothly varying intensity, rather than the contour plot looking similar might look like a zebra.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Error Bars:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">All graphs with experimentally measured points must have error bars or some equivalent indication of the uncertainty of the measurement. Error bars are usually short, vertical lines drawn at each data point with even shorter horizontal lines at their ends. The vertical length of the error bar above the point is the standard deviation of the measurement. The best way to calculate it is to take several measurements of the same data point under different conditions and calculate the standard deviation from them. The measurements could be taken as some independent quantity is increased and then again when it is decreased (to see if there is hysteresis). They could be taken at different times of the day, and different days (to see if temperature, wind, vibration, humidity affects the readings). It is not acceptable to say that your graph drawing package cannot plot error bars. You should get one that does or draw the error bars by hand. The graph-plotting package is a tool and you need to get a tool that does what you want. Alternatively, it is satisfactory to plot a second and third line above and below the data point line representing the data points plus and minus one standard deviation. It would be best to have the space between one standard deviation above and below, to be coloured or shaded in grey, and to colour and shade two standard deviations above and below a lighter shade and so on. Note that the error bars are likely to be different lengths for different data points and may be different lengths above and below the data point, particularly if the data has been non linearly compressed on a logarithmic scale or rescaled using an equation. Sometimes, rarely it may also be appropriate to draw horizontal error bars as well. Also, rarely, it may be appropriate to put error bars on theoretical calculations to indicate the error in fitting a curve or an approximation made in the theory, for example.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Tables:</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">If you are comparing the pros and cons of two or more methods, or hardware, or whatever, you must use a table not a list in the text. Every report should have a comparison even if it is just what you have done compared to others before.</p>
</font><b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="CENTER">Chapter 6 Redrafting</p>
</font></b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">Sentences which have been added as a result of supervisors� corrections, and sentences which you have cut and pasted in, can seem to a reader to not fit in with the flow of text and appear as an afterthought. The secret is to take some time to decide exactly where in the existing text would be the best place to insert the sentence, and then to be willing to rewrite it to suit the context while retaining the essence of the content.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The same word can appear as the last word on one page and again as the first word on the next page. Alternatively some words can get lost between one page and the next. These can be caused by the word processor if you just print out sections of the work at different times using different printers, or different font or formatting for part of the work. It commonly occurs when a page with coloured figures is printed out on a colour printer while the adjacent pages are printed on a black and white printer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Make sure all of the references to papers are there at the back in the list of references. Make sure that all of the references to figures are to the correct figure number. This is an easy mistake as you may have deleted or added some figures.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Check for extra brackets �)� or missing ones.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The spelling and grammar checkers have problems in lists of references as they do not recognise names and abbreviations so you will have to go through the reference list proof reading it yourself.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Academic level</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">Supervisors often indicate corrections that are needed and some faults occur very often. Here are some of the most common comments written by supervisors:</p>
<ol>

<li>Why?</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Lack of explanation of statements or references. Justify or reference. Students sometimes make assertions or statements without justifying them.</p>
<li>Logic</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Logical progression of ideas from sentence to sentence is essential to show that you can think clearly and to make your case. Every paragraph must progress logically from sentence to sentence making a case without leaving holes in the logic.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Don�t write text assuming the reader knows something, when it is only later in the document that you explain to the reader what it is that you were assuming he knew earlier. This is often a result of a lack of a good outline at the start and cut and pasting something that was originally written later, to an earlier position.</p>
<li>Too Vague</li></ol>
<dir>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A common criticism is that the text is too vague and that there is a lack of numbers quantifying the phenomenon. The text may only deal with the topic superficially or qualitatively whereas numbers and graphs are required.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p></dir>

</font><b><p align="JUSTIFY">Back-up</p>
</b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">It is common every year, about a week before the deadline for the handing in of the final report, for a student to lose three chapters (or more) of his report due to computer related problems. This is a normal occurrence and you should not be surprised by it. So it should be budgeted for in the time plan and corrective action implemented. Perhaps the computer is being used more intensively than it has been all year at this time, or a laptop may be being transported back and forth more often from home to college and more subject to jolts, or a magnetic floppy disc with the text on it may be erased if you sit too close to the motors on underground �tube� electric trains as they emanate a strong magnetic field, or viruses are spread due to students sharing files or formats. You may have deleted the file by accident or stored an older version away on top of a newer version. It is possible to appeal to the examiners for extra time due to unforeseen circumstances but this will most likely be rejected if the circumstances could be foreseen. Certainly if the examiners had warned you of this then you will not get extra time. After all, part of the point of the exercise is to simulate a real life firm deadline situation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The student must then recover the situation as best he can. This usually means a frantic retyping in of the last hardcopy output that can be found easily. In addition the student has to recall what corrections his supervisor recommended to this last hard copy (as it is likely that his supervisor�s corrections will have been thrown away) and he must also remember what corrections he made himself. A friend may be called in to help retype in the text in parallel with the student himself. If this friend is not technically competent or is not very familiar with English then the text may end up not making complete sense, and supervisor�s corrections, if available, may get typed in word for word instead of interpreting them. If the friend is more technically competent or has better command of English then the text may be so improved (as he may inadvertently correct mistakes as he enters the text) that it will look a bit odd to the examiner in comparison with all of the rest of the text. Moreover, when the student is questioned on the text he may be surprised, since they are not, in fact his words. The hardcopy may not be the most recent so lots of errors will get typed back into the text. There will be such a rush that the student will not have the time to proof read the text to remove typographical errors or perhaps may not even have the time to run a spelling and grammar checker. Such errors will lose the student many marks when the examiner sees it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Students have failed or almost failed important projects due to loss of text near deadlines. So the moral is keep back ups. Keep them on several different media: magnetic floppy discs, magnetic hard discs, compact optical discs, in several different locations: home, college, work. Update them ALL at regular intervals. When you are working hard producing lots of text or revisions you will need to back up more often. Label your files so that you can distinguish which revision it is. Ideally arrange that the printout has the revision number printed on it. Some word processors can output the date and time of printing as well as the revision number and filename automatically. If you just leave it up to your memory to remember to back up you will not do it enough. It is better to set up a regular routine. So every day before you stop work allow enough time to back up the days work on different media.</p>

These sentences break the smooth flow of the text and can all be rewritten.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Use of proper clauses ***.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Tense:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Keep the same tense for verbs throughout a paragraph, section and ideally throughout a chapter. Obviously if you are referring to past events you will need to use a past tense. Don�t use past tense to refer to future events . It is common to begin with a past tense and to change to a present one as the description of the work comes up to date. However, this can seem odd to a reader since it is all in the past by the time the report is finally written and read. So, for example, �The initial system is set up by X and a laser is used� would sound better if written � The initial system was set up by X and a laser was used�. Of course, all sentences must have a verb. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Verb</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Please ensure that every sentence has a verb. Take care to use the correct voice, active or passive. For example, �This process was taken place� should be �This process took place�. Do not use split infinitives, for example, �to strongly etch�. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Singular and plural:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Take care to ensure that the subjects and objects of a verb that require plurals are made plural. The plural of research is research not �researches�. Singulars instead of plurals and vice versa. Plural instead of singular verbs, for example, �are� instead of �is� or vice versa and, for example, �was� instead of �were�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A, An, The:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is not correct to refer to �the� event or object when the event or object has not been referred to before. Use of �the� instead of �a�. The presence of an extra �the� where it does not belong. Commonly �the�, �a�, and �an� are missed out and sometimes �the� is lost. This is a mistake of students when they are used to writing notes during lectures missing out these words. The report, however, is not a set of notes but must be good flowing English text. This sometimes occurs when the student is trying to keep the number of words down. So it may occur in the abstract which tends to get written last and not proof read enough although this is one of the first things the reader reads in detail and indicates to him the quality of the whole report. The same students that miss out �a� also sometimes add extra ones where they should not be. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It, Him, Her</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Inanimate objects should usually be referred to as �it� and not �him�.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Capitals or Upper Case letters:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Capital letters must be used at the start of a sentence and for all proper nouns. Capital letters should not be used elsewhere in the text. Section titles should use capital letters. In titles you can either only make the first letter of the phrase a capital letter or you can make the first letter of most of the main words a capital letter. In the latter case, do not put small linking words in capitals, such as �and� or �its� or �the�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It�s and its</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This</p>
</font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">It is a good rule to always qualify the word �this� when you use it as it is often unclear to the reader to what it refers. Supervisors will often fill the text with comments such as �what?� or �which?� as an indication of this error. A supervisor�s comment, �what?� written above a reversed </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">l</font><font size="2"> placed between and slightly below two words, does not mean, insert the word �what?� into the text at that point. It means insert a phrase explaining what?� at that point.</font></p><font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Prepositions and small words:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Think carefully whether you should be using the first word or the second in the following examples. In each case the first word had been used incorrectly and the second word should have been used.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Spelling:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Although word processing packages have spelling checkers they cannot check people�s names. Ensure that you have loaded the UK version of the spelling checker as American English has different spellings. The English spelling Fibre should replace the American spelling Fiber. English words have �ise endings rather than the American �ize endings. Analyzer should be analyser</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Polarisation instead of Polarization.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Always use the spelling and grammar word processor checkers. Double check words which are not in the standard dictionary and then add them to your local personal dictionary. Don�t add incorrectly spelt words; it is better not to add words than to do that. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Kirchhoff is the correct spelling.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If an incorrectly spelt word in the context is actually a correctly spelled word in another context the spelling checker will not find it. For example, �lager� instead of �larger�, �black� instead of �block�, �tiled� instead of �tilt�, �site� or �sight�, �lined� instead of �lines�, �data� or �date�, �phrase� and �phase�, �form� and �from�, �models� and �modes�, �assure� and �ensure�, �affected� and �effected�, �device� and �devise�, �loosing� and �losing�, �expensive� and �expansive�, �exited� and �excited�, �were� and �where�, �be� and �by�.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�Led� instead of �leaded�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Hence, Thus, Therefore, However</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When students speak about their project they do not use the word �Hence� but as soon as they begin writing down their description of their project they use the word �Hence� repeatedly. If these words are used too much in text it can begin to sound more like a mathematical argument than a coherent piece of prose. When these words are used at the start of a sentence a comma should follow them. When these words occur in the middle of text they usually relate two phrases and, therefore, usually require both preceding and following commas. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">i.e. , e.g., for example, etc.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The use of i.e. and e.g. to give an example has waned over the last thirty years and it is currently not fashionable. It is better to say �For example, ��. Try to avoid using etc. preferring instead to give one or two examples to illustrate the various classes of example.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Type of English</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Scottish:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In Scottish English there are words and phrases in common usage which may not be acceptable to an English examiner, such as the use of the word �outwith�.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Numbers</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Try to avoid typing integer numerals (less than ten) in the text unless you are in the chapters dealing with measuring quantities or are referring to the size of a measured quantity. Instead, type the word, for example, �two� and write �first� instead of 1<sup>st</sup> in text. The reasoning behind this is that text should be just that, text, not maths. It is more reader friendly to put text in a textual context. If you were reading a poem it would seem a bit odd to find integers embedded in the text. Integers greater than ten also tend to look better in words, for example, �thirty�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Emphasis</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In speech we emphasise certain words and some students indicate this by making those words, bold, italic or underlined. The text can become hard to read if there are a lot of these words. It is usually better to avoid emphasis, in this way, but instead to emphasise a point by use of text.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Chatty, Colloquial, Informal English:</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">In order to make the text come alive and not seem dry, dead and formal (and so boring to the reader) it is good to make it more like spoken speech. Tape record conversations between yourself and your friends or supervisor (you must obtain his permission first!) where you are explaining how something works. Then write these down as your text. However, there is a limit to this and certain phrases and words do need to be changed as this is a written report and not a transcript of your conversations with your supervisor.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Extreme words:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Everyone, every � is a dangerous thing to say as there is bound to be an exception which invalidates your statement. Indeed this is a challenge for the examiner to find an exception!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Optimum � a dangerous thing to say as a reader who thinks his method is better or his result is best will be annoyed and will argue with you. Optimum can be used if it is justified mathematically in the text, for example, by finding the maximum turning point of a function.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Never � dangerous as it is very hard to prove, and prove it you must if you use this word.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�Material science has advanced in recent years at an explosive rate�. � The use of the word �explosive� in this context may be acceptable in journalism but is not acceptable in this context in a technical report where it could easily be misinterpreted.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�Massively parallel computing� � Although this phrase was in common usage amongst engineers in the 1990�s it is a misuse of the word �massive� (having a lot of mass).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Qualitative words:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Huge, Tremendous, big, great factor, </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Large, many, much, a lot, a small amount, enormous are too vague</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mostly, mainly must be quantitatively qualified.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�the range has been considerably reduced.� - To what, from what or relative to what?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When describing a three dimensional object it is no good saying it is long, wide, high, deep, thick without defining which dimension you are talking about.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�Big picture� could be better written as �overview�.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Titles:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The following should be avoided:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�A bit of history�, for the title of the review section.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�What benefits does anyone gain from this project�, as a subsection title?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�Ways of cutting the cost�, as a subsection title</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Verb:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�Figured out� is a bit chatty and American (not wrong in itself but may be frowned upon by an English Examiner who wants an English and not an American report)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Replace abbreviated verbs by their full spelling:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Don�t becomes do not. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�The optical fibre doesn�t care�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�World of communications�, �Explain the ins and outs�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Wordy English:</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">�This necessitates the taking of more than three measurements.� Could become �So at least three measurements must be taken�</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clarity:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One of your main aims is to explain as logically and clearly as you can so that your meaning cannot be misunderstood. However, this sometimes leads to authors writing too many words so take care to be concise. Some students use a word and follow it by more words which explain the first word in more detail but which have the same meaning. Short sentences on the same topic as the following sentence can be linked to it as one sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>Choice of words</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">Many words gain extra shades of meaning through usage and so a word which may have been perfectly acceptable twenty years ago may require care in its use now. Often the word means the same thing but an extra phrase could be added to its meaning saying � and this is good� or � and this is bad�.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�Notions� implies a not very well thought out idea which is unlikely to work and not simply an idea.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">An �irrelevant� idea implies a bad criticism of the idea, that it was not worth doing and a waste of time, that one�s mind should be shut to any further consideration of the idea and that one should move on in another direction, rather than that the idea is simply not something that needed to be considered at the moment as it just happened not to link to the topic under discussion.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Typographical Errors:</p>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY">Since the advent of word processors, examiners have seen many reports with the same sentence or phrase repeated word for word in several different parts of the report due to the use of �cut and paste�. This is particularly apparent if the phrase has a mistake in it. Do not keep repeating things. Assume the examiner will read every sentence so he does not need to read it twice. It can be beneficial sometimes to repeat a point. In that case use a different construction of words to repeat the point. It is particularly annoying to find the same point repeated several times and in each case unclearly, so that the reader cannot understand it. It is obviously important to the writer so the author should expand on it. It is better to explain it once clearly than say it several times badly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Repeated words such as �the the� or �of of� sometimes occur due to cut and paste and may not be identified by the word processing package.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY">Miscellaneous Examples of Errors</p>
</b><p>See if you can see what is wrong with the following examples:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�I know we live in a commercial, but sometimes we need to consider other things apart from cost�.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�Circular shaped triangles�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�There is also a black diagram, �.., which is in diagram form. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�The system is employed by the polarizers and a quarter wave plate.�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�The rays has bent the original path due to the effect of refraction�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�It is clear that people who wish to use lasers, has to be understood by the safety rules�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�Do not look into a laser bean, � It may cause eyes. Wear safety gaggle�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�The distributed feedback laser has a wide active region. The use of a grated layer offers the ability to produce a very narrow linewidth beam�..If we remove the middle, graded area then we increase the output power�</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">�No coaxial cables take place in this fibre optic system�</p>
